# casbah journal plugin
#
# A journal must support the following akka-persistence rule:
#
# When a PersistentActor's persist/persistAsync method completes successfully, we can safely assume the message has
# persisted to the store. As a result, this journal implementation enforces journaled on all write concerns and
# requires all mongo instance(s) to enable journaling.

  # woption:
  # The w option requests acknowledgment that the write operation has propagated to a specified number of mongod
  # instances or to mongod instances with specified tags. Mongo's wOption can be either an Int or String and this
  # journal implementation supports both with woption.
  #
  # If woption is an Int, then the write concern requests acknowledgment that the write operation has propagated to the
  # specified number of mongod instances. Note: The woption cannot be set to zero.
  #
  # If woption is a String, then the value can be either "majority" or a "tag set" name. If the value is "majority"
  # then the write concern requests acknowledgment that write operations have propagated to the majority of voting
  # nodes. If the value is a "tag set" name, the write concern requests acknowledgment that the write operations have
  # propagated to a replica set member with the specified tag. The default value is an integer value of 1.

  # wtimeout:
  # This option specifies a time limit, in milliseconds, for the write concern. If you do not specify the wtimeout
  # option, and the level of write concern is unachievable, the write operation will block indefinitely. Specifying
  # a wtimeout value of 0 is equivalent to a write concern without the wTimeout option. The default value is 10000
